# Microservices  

Prerequisite:  
- Spring boot
- Project using monolithic Architecture- Multiple components are combined in a single large app. its single code base, deployed in single bundle. change is one service then whole app is redeployed.  
- In Microservices - large app divided into small parts- they can communicate with Rest API or message brokers- Apache kafka, Rabbit MQ, Active MQ.
- All parts will have different code base bundled differently and can be scalable seperately.
-  We can use Different tech Stack- Handling microservices is complex.
-  Like we made 3 services Hotel service, User service, Rating Service using 3 independent DB.
-  OKTA Auth- we can doing Authentication in microservices.
-  we need service registry - to register all services here. And we can store with names so even if IP address is changed we can still get then access and call back.
